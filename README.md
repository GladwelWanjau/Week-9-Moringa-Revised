# Week-9-Moringa-Revised
This is my submission for my week 9 project in Moringa School
This is my submission for my week 9 project in Moringa School which is a requirement and a major tool used to evaluate one's understanding of the week's content.
We were tasked with two projects in this particular week whereby we were supposed to use two Machine Learning techniques learnt during the week that is K Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes Estimator.
In the first project we were tasked to predict the probability of passengers surviving the titanic accident and explore factors that could have caused the same. I therefore went ahead to utilize the K Nearest Neighbour to find out the factors that influenced the same such as the age and gender of the passenger.
In the second project we were tasked to come up with a spam filter that detects whether an email is spam or not.In this case I used the Naive Bayes Estimator.
For both models the accuracy was more 80% and above which was sufficient but this could be improved further by tuning the parameters some more.
